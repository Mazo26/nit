In React.js, a component is a piece of code that represents a part of a user interface. 
It can be a class component or a functional component. 
Class component is a js class that extends React.Component class, while a functional
component is a js
function that returns only the React element.

A PureComeponent is a special type of component that is similar to a component, 
but with additional features
or optimizations. When a component is a PureComeponent, 
React will do a shallow comparison of the props and
state before re-rendering the component. That means that if props and state 
have not changed, the component
will not be re-rendering. This can lead to a performance boost in some cases, 
but if it's not used properly,
it can lead to unexpected behaviour.

Bottomline, a componenent is the most basic and most used for building 
a block in React and PureComeponent
is used when it needs some special optimizations.

Props(properties) is a way for manipulating data and states
We can send data through props and we can send 
data to parent through props
