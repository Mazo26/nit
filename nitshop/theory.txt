In React.js, a component is a piece of code that represents a part of a user interface. 
It can be a class component or a functional component. 
Class component is a js class that extends React.Component class, while a functional
component is a js
function that returns only the React element.

A PureComeponent is a special type of component that is similar to a component, 
but with additional features
or optimizations. When a component is a PureComeponent, 
React will do a shallow comparison of the props and
state before re-rendering the component. That means that if props and state 
have not changed, the component
will not be re-rendering. This can lead to a performance boost in some cases, 
but if it's not used properly,
it can lead to unexpected behaviour.

Bottomline, a componenent is the most basic and most used for building 
a block in React and PureComeponent
is used when it needs some special optimizations.

Props(properties) is a way for manipulating data and states
We can send data through props and we can send 
data to parent through props

Parent component is component which is created
Child component is component which is included in Parent component
Parent componenent can have more than one Child compinents
Child components can be also found in other components as children(prop)
children as a prop is a reserved name  


Practise for class:
- Build a simple counter which will increment number by clicking the button
(styling is optional)

- Build to-do app (styling is optional)

cd - change directory je komanda u terminalu
koja sluzi za navigiranje kroz foldere unutar sistema

ls - je komanda koja sluzi za izlistavanje
fajlova i foldera unutar foldera

mkdir - make directory je komanda koja sluzi
za kreiranje novog direktorija ili foldera

rm - is a commad which removes file or directory
for directory we use special flag -rf "rm -rf someFolder"

for step back, we use "cd .." command
